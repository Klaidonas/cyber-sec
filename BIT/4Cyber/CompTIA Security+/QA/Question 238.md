> on-path attack, also known as a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, occurs when an attacker intercepts the communication between two parties (in this case, the user and the airline's website). Since the user was on a public Wi-Fi network and ignored security warnings, it's possible that the attacker was able to intercept the credit card information during the transaction, leading to unauthorized charges.
