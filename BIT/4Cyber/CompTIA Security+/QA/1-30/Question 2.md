Which of the following is used to add extra complexity before using a one-way data transformation algorithm? 

A. Key stretching 
B. Data masking 
C. Steganography 
D. Salting

> D. Salting. Salting is used to add extra complexity before using a one-way data transformation algorithm, such as a hash function. Salting involves adding a unique, random value to the input data before it is processed by the hash function, making it more resistant to certain types of attacks like rainbow table attacks.
