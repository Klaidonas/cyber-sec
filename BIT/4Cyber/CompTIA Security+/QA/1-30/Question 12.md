> A penetration test would be checking the security practices of your supply chain to ensure they are not easily tampered with, but does not address the lack of reliability, & authenticity that would protect a company from the possible procurement of faulty supplies/hardware like an analysis would.An enforced acquisition policy would be a bad practice especially if the parts were faulty.A right to audit clause, & Statement of Work (SOW) is the first step to allowing an analysis, or penetration test of vendor services, & goods.
