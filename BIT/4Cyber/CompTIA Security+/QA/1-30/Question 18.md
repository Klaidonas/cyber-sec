> A. Secured Zones :In the context of implementing Zero Trust principles within the data plane, secured zones are most relevant. Zero Trust principles emphasize the need to eliminate implicit trust and enforce strict access controls. By evaluating and implementing secured zones, an organization can ensure that data is compartmentalized and that access is tightly controlled, aligning with the core tenets of Zero Trust. This approach helps to contain threats and limit lateral movement within the network, providing a strong foundation for a Zero Trust architecture.
