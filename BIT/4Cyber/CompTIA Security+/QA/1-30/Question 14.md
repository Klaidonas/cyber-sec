> A. Active Active reconnaissance involves actively probing and scanning the target environment to gather information. This typically includes activities such as port and service scans, vulnerability scans, and other direct interactions with the target systems to identify potential weaknesses or entry points.Passive reconnaissance, on the other hand, involves gathering information without directly interacting with the target systems, such as monitoring network traffic or analyzing publicly available information. Options C and D, defensive and offensive reconnaissance, respectively, are not standard reconnaissance types typically used in the context of penetration testing.
