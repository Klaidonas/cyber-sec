> To prevent unauthorized logins from suspicious IP addresses and enhance the security of user accounts, the administrator should implement: A. Multifactor authentication Multifactor authentication (MFA) requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource such as an application, online account, or VPN. This security measure significantly reduces the likelihood of unauthorized access because even if an attacker has the password, they would still need the additional verification factor(s), such as a code from a mobile device, a fingerprint, or a hardware token.
