> BContainerization allows multiple applications or services to run in isolated environments on the same underlying OS. Unlike, virtualization where each VM runs its own OS, containers share the host OS kernel but keep the applications isolated from one another. This significantly reduces the number of operating systems required while maintaining security and isolation between applications.
