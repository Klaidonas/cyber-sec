> C. Retention policy.Reasoning:Security policy: While a security policy is important for protecting sensitive information, it doesn't specifically address the retention and destruction of records.Classification policy: A classification policy helps categorize information based on its sensitivity and value, but it doesn't provide guidelines for how long records should be retained or when they should be destroyed.Retention policy: A retention policy establishes rules for how long different types of records should be kept and when they can be destroyed. This is exactly what the company needs to meet compliance requirements and minimize the number of records it needs to store.Access control policy: An access control policy governs who can access different types of information. While it's important for data protection, it doesn't directly address the retention and destruction of records.Therefore, a retention policy is the best option for the company to meet its requirements of keeping the fewest records possible, meeting compliance needs, and ensuring destruction of records that are no longer needed.
