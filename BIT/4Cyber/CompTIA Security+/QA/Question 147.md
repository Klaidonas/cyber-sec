> Answer - BSmishing, a combination of the words "SMS" and "phishing", is a type of cybercrime that uses deceptive text messages to trick people into sharing sensitive information or downloading malware. Smishing messages may appear to be from a reputable company, such as a bank, and may include a link or phone number to entice the recipient into clicking or calling. If the victim interacts with the message as intended, they may be led to a fraudulent website where they enter personal or financial information, or they may unknowingly download malicious software onto their device. If they call a number, the attacker may try to trick them into providing information verbally or incurring charges.
