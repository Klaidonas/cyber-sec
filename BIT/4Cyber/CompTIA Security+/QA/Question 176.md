> B. HashingHashing is the most likely recommendation for protecting a log-in database. By hashing passwords, the organization ensures that even if the database is breached, the actual passwords are not exposed in plaintext. Hashing converts passwords into a fixed-size string of characters, which is not reversible, thus protecting user credentials.Therefore, the correct answer is:B. Hashing.
