> C. Update the EDR policies to block automatic execution of downloaded programs. While raising awareness, implementing email filters, and providing additional training are important measures, updating Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) policies to block the automatic execution of downloaded programs directly addresses the issue of reducing the impact when a user clicks on a phishing link. This approach helps prevent malicious software from being executed on the user's system, thus mitigating potential harm. Therefore, the correct answer is: C. Update the EDR policies to block automatic execution of downloaded programs.
