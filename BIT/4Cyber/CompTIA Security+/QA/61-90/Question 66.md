> A. Compensating control A compensating control is a security measure that is put in place to satisfy the requirements of a security policy or standard when the primary control cannot be implemented. In this case, the host-based firewall on a legacy Linux system allowing connections from only specific internal IP addresses serves as a compensating control to protect the system by limiting access to trusted sources. Therefore, the correct answer is: A. Compensating control.
