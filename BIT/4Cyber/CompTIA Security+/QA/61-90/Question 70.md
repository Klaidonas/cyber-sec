> A. Tuning.Tuning refers to the process of adjusting the configuration of a system, in this case, the security operations center’s detection systems, to reduce or eliminate the number of false positives. In this context, if the so-called “malicious activity” is determined to be normal and is expected to recur, the system can be tuned to ignore this activity in the future, preventing unnecessary alerts.Please note that while the other options (B. Aggregating, C. Quarantining, D. Archiving) are activities related to managing and responding to security events, they do not specifically apply to the scenario of ignoring detected activity in the future.
