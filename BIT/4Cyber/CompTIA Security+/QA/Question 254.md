> B is correct. You start collecting forensic contents based on the order of volatility which is from the most volatile to the least. You collect CPU, Cache and Registers first and RAM 2nd which contains active processes, open network connections, user sessions and temp data which are lost when the system is powered off. Temporary files and hard drive/SSD comes last in the order receptively.
