> A. Patch availabilityThe primary security implication of using end-of-life operating systems is the lack of patch availability. End-of-life systems no longer receive security updates or patches from the vendor, making them vulnerable to known exploits and security vulnerabilities that will not be fixed. This poses a significant risk to the security of the kiosks and the overall network.Therefore, the correct answer is:A. Patch availability.
