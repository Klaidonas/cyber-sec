> To ensure sensitive data at rest is rendered unreadable, the company will most likely use encryption. Encryption transforms the data into an unreadable format using an algorithm and a key, and only authorized parties with the correct decryption key can convert it back to its original readable form. This is the most effective way to protect data at rest from unauthorized access.
