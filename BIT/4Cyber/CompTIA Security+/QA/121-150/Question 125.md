> Segmentation would best mitigate the network access vulnerability in the OS of legacy IoT devices quickly. By segmenting the network, you can isolate the vulnerable devices from the rest of the network, thereby limiting potential access and reducing the risk of exploitation. This is often faster than patching or replacing the devices, especially if patches are not immediately available or replacement is not feasible in the short term.
