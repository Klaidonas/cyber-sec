> Explanation: C. [WAF](../../Glossary/WAF.md) (Web Application Firewall)A [WAF](../../Glossary/WAF.md) is specifically designed to protect web applications by filtering and monitoring [HTTP](../../Glossary/HTTP.md) traffic between a web application and the internet. It can help prevent attacks such as [SQL](../../Glossary/SQL.md) injection, cross-site scripting ([XSS](../../Glossary/XSS.md)), and other web-based threats that could target the new service accessed through the web portal.
