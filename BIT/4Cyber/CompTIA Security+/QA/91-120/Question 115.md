> CertyIQ In an air-gapped network, which is physically isolated from other networks, the most common data loss path would typically be through removable devices (option D). These can include USB drives, external hard drives, or other storage devices that could be introduced into the network, intentionally or unintentionally, by users or external entities. This is because such devices can bypass the physical isolation of the air gap and introduce potential security vulnerabilities.
