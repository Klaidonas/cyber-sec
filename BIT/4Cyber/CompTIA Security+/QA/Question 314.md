> Explanation: D. Select an [IdP](../../Glossary/IdP.md) (Identity Provider)Selecting an IdP is the initial step in implementing Single Sign-On (SSO) or federated identity management, which will allow employees to use a single set of credentials to access multiple SaaS applications. After selecting an IdP, the security team can then enable [SAML](../../Glossary/SAML.md) or other [SSO](../../Glossary/SSO.md) protocols to integrate with the applications and manage authentication.
