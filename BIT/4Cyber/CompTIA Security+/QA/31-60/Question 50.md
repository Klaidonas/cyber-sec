> D. WarmA warm site is a middle ground between hot and cold sites. It typically contains some of the necessary infrastructure and data replication capabilities, but it's not as fully operational or costly as a hot site. In a warm site, some essential systems are ready to be activated quickly in the event of a disaster or disruption. This makes it suitable for scenarios where the RTO and RPO values are not immediate, such as in this case where they are around two days, while still being more cost-effective compared to a hot site.
