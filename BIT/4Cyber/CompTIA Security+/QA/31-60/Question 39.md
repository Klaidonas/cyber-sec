> Client: In the shared responsibility model, the client, or cloud customer, is responsible for securing their data and applications running on the cloud infrastructure. This includes configuring security settings, implementing access controls, and managing user permissions for their resources. However, the specific responsibility for securing the company's database in an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model depends on the division of responsibilities outlined in the model.Given the options provided and the context of the shared responsibility model for a cloud environment, the most appropriate role responsible for securing the company's database in an IaaS model would be Client. The client is typically responsible for securing their data and applications, including databases, within the cloud infrastructure. However, the DBA would also play a significant role in implementing database security measures within the IaaS environment, working in collaboration with the client's security team.
