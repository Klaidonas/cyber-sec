Audit findingsWhile fines, sanctions, and reputation damage can be potential consequences of failing to meet PCI DSS compliance, the most immediate and likely outcome of failing an internal PCI DSS compliance assessment is the generation of audit findings. These findings will detail the areas of non-compliance and typically result in the organization needing to take corrective actions to address the identified issues. If the findings are not addressed, this could lead to further consequences such as fines, sanctions, or reputation damage. Therefore, the correct answer is:B. Audit findings.
