> When designing a high-availability network, two key considerations are:A. Ease of recovery D. Responsiveness - Ease of recovery. This is essential for high availability because the network must be able to recover quickly from failures to minimize downtime.- Responsiveness. Ensuring that the network can handle high traffic loads and respond quickly to user requests is crucial for maintaining high availability.Other factors like physical isolation, ability to patch, attack surface, and extensible authentication are important for security and maintenance but are not primary considerations for high availability.Therefore, the correct answers are:A. Ease of recovery D. Responsiveness.
