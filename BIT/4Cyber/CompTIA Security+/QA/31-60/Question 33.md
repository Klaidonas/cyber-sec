> The correct answer is:D. SQL injectionSQL injection is a type of attack that involves inserting malicious SQL statements into an input field. These statements can then be executed by the database, allowing the attacker to view or manipulate the data. This can lead to unauthorized access to the database, data leakage, or even the modification and deletion of data.Hereâ€™s why the other options are not correct in this context:- A. This involves injecting malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users, but it does not specifically involve running commands that directly view or manipulate data in a database. - B This typically refers to installing applications from unofficial sources, not related to input fields and running commands. -C. This involves exploiting a program by writing more data to a buffer than it can hold, potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code, but it does not specifically use input fields to run commands on data.
