Since the logs on the endpoint were deleted, the security analyst would likely turn to firewall logs. Firewall logs can provide information about network traffic, including outbound connections that may indicate communication with a command-and-control server. These logs can help the analyst identify suspicious traffic patterns or unauthorized communication that bypassed endpoint defenses.
