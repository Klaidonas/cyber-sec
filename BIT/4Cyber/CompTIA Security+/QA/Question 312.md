> Explanation: CertyIQ D. Branch protection requirementsBranch protection requirements are related to the version control and development process within the [SDLC](../../Glossary/SDLC.md), ensuring that code changes are reviewed, tested, and approved before being merged into main branches. This helps maintain code quality and security throughout the development process.Penetration testing is usually conducted as part of the testing phase or after deployment to identify vulnerabilities and security weaknesses. It is a separate process from the core stages of the [SDLC](../../Glossary/SDLC.md) but is an important aspect of ensuring the security and robustness of the application once development is completed.
