> A. Load balancerA load balancer is the most appropriate solution to ensure accessibility of a business-critical application during peak usage times. It distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers, optimizing resource utilization, maximizing throughput, minimizing response time, and avoiding overload on any single server. This is particularly crucial for a multinational bank's customer-facing application during high-traffic periods.
