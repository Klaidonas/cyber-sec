> BSAML is widely used protocol for enabling SSO across different applications and systems, particularly in enterprise environments. It allows users to authentication once and gain access to multiple application, including cloud based services. RADUIS is typically used for network access authentication and is not generally used for SSO with cloud based applications. EAP is used for network authentication protocols particularly in wireless networks and does not apply to SSO.OpenID is an identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0 for authentication but is less commonly used in enterprise environments compared to SAML for SSO.
