A Group Policy Object (GPO) is a virtual collection of policy settings. A GPO has a unique name, such as a GUID.

Group Policy settings are contained in a GPO. A GPO can represent policy settings in the file system and in the Active Directory. GPO settings are evaluated by clients using the hierarchical nature of Active Directory.
