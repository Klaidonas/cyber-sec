The equation for single-loss expectancy is:

_SLE = AV * EF_

Asset value (AV) is the value per share as determined on a specific date or time. Exposure factor (EF) is measured as a percentage and calculates the potential loss that could occur to an asset if a specific threat is realised.

For example, if an asset is valued at £100,000 and the exposure factor for the asset is 25%, the single-loss expectancy equals £25,000 (£100,000/25% = £25,000).

As an investor you should be looking for companies with a low single-loss expectancy in order to limit your risk.
