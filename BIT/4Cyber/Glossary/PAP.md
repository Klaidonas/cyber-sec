# Password Authentication Protocol

PAP is a password Authentication Protocol used by PPP links to validate users. PAP authentication requires the calling device to enter the username and password. If the credentials match with the local database of the called device or in the remote AAA database then it is allowed to access otherwise denied. 

Some of the features of PAP are:   

1. The password is sent in cleartext.    
2. All network operating systems support PAP.     
3. It uses a two-way Handshake Protocol.      
4. It is non-interactive.      
5. PAP supports both one-way authentication (unidirectional) and two-way authentication (bidirectional).
