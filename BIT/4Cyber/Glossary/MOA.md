A memorandum of agreement, or MOA, is a legal document describing a [business partnership](https://www.contractscounsel.com/t/us/business-partnership) between two parties that have agreed to cooperate to meet an agreed objective or complete a project. The memorandum lays out the agreed terms and outlines the steps to reach the desired goal of the agreement.

MOAs are usually used when money is involved, but that is not always the case.
