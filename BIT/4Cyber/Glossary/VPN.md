acronym:: VPN

standsfor:: Virtual Private Network

definition:: By connecting through a VPN, all the data you send and receive travels through an encrypted "tunnel" so that no one can see what you are transmitting or decipher it if they do get a hold of it. VPNs also allow you to hide your physical location and IP address, often displaying the IP address of the VPN service, instead.
