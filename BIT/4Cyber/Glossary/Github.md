[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a popular web service designed for software developers. The site is used to host and share the source code of applications to allow a collaborative effort. However, security researchers have taken to this platform because of the aforementioned reasons as well. Security researchers store & share [[PoC]]’s (Proof of Concept) on GitHub, turning it into an exploit database in this context.

GitHub is extremely useful in finding rare or fresh exploits because anyone can create an account and upload – there is no formal verification process like there is with alternative exploit databases. With that said, there is also a downside in that [[PoC]]’s may not work where little to no support will be provided.

GitHub uses a tagging and keyword system, meaning that we can search GitHub by keywords such as “[[PoC]]”, “[[vulnerability]]”, and many more. At the time of writing, there are 9,682 repositories with the keyword “[[CVE]]”. We are also able to filter the results by programming language.
