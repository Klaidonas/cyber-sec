# Memorandum of understanding

A **memorandum of understanding** (**MoU**) is a type of agreement between two ([bilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism "Bilateralism")) or more ([multilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateralism "Multilateralism")) parties. It expresses a convergence of will between the parties, indicating an intended common line of action.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorandum_of_understanding#cite_note-1) It is often used either in cases where parties do not imply a legal commitment or in situations where the parties cannot create a legally enforceable agreement.
