**Simple Network Management Protocol** (**SNMP**) is an [Internet Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Standard "Internet Standard") protocol for collecting and organizing information about managed devices on [IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol") networks and for modifying that information to change device behavior. Devices that typically support SNMP include [cable modems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_modem "Cable modem"), [routers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing) "Router (computing)"), [network switches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch "Network switch"), servers, workstations, printers, and more.
