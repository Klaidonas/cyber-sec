1. Treat security as an integral part of the overall system design.
2. Ensure that developers are trained in how to develop secure software 
3. Assume that external systems are insecure 
4. Protect information while being processed, in transit, and in storage 
5. Where possible, base security on open standards for portability and interoperability 
6. Implement layered security 
7. Isolate public access systems from mission critical resources 
8. Implement least privilege 
9. Ensure proper security in the shutdown or disposal of a system.
