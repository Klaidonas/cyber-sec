- Incorporate security measures across all architecture layers (business, data, applications, technology).
- Balance security requirements with accessibility needs, ensuring secure design at all levels.
- Restrict application-database access using unique user privileges to minimize risks.
- Review designs against known attack patterns and vulnerabilities.
- Prioritize technologies with proven security track records.
- Sanitize input data and eliminate debugging codes to prevent vulnerabilities.
