ISO 27001 is **not** prescriptive on grouping controls into policies and procedures

**Two approaches**

**Big companies** : A **policy** for each section of Annex A, A **procedure** for **each** control 
	Example of policy : Asset Management Policy (A.8), Access Control Policy (A.9)
	Example of procedure : A.8.1.1. Asset inventory procedure, A.8.1.3.4 Asset return procedure
**Small companies** : A **policy** or **procedure** that covers **many** controls in one document 
	Example : Supplier relationship policy that covers all the five controls of section A.15
