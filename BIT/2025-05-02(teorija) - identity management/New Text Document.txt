Access control principles:
	dazniausiai yra 1 auščiausiasis administratorius
	
Access control Policies:
	Dictates:
		what types of access are permitted
		under what circumstances
		by whom
		
Access Control Requirements:
	reliable input;
	support for fine and coarse specifications;
	least privilege;
	separation of duty;
	open and closed policies;
	policy combinations and conflict rtesolution;
	administrative policies;
	dual control
	
Protection Domains:
	user mode;
	kernel mode
	
Access Control List(ACL):
	modern systems support ACL's;
	Assigns a list of user IDs and groups;
	Any number of users and groups can be associated with an object;
	Read, write, execute protection bits;
	A file does not need to have an ACL;
	Usuall includes an additional protection bit that indicates whether the file has an extended ACL.
	
ACL usage(2 steps):
	1: selects the most appropriate ACL(owner, named users, owning/named groups, others;
	2: checks if the matching entry contains sufficient permissions.

Managing Accounts:
	consider 'disabled by default' policy;
	consider 'zero trust' point of view;
	credential policies and account types:
		presonnel or end-user accounts;
		administrator and root accounts;
		service accounts;
		device accounts;
		third-party accounts;
		guest accounts *turetu iš viso nebūt tokių nebent koks guest wifi acocunt*;
		shared and generic accounts
		
Privileged Access Management(PAM):
	sometimes called privileged account management;
	allows an organization to apply more stringent security controls over accounts with elevated privileges;
	PAM implements the concept of just-in-time administration
	Administrators don't have administrative privileges until they need them;
	when they need them, their account sends a request for the elevated privileges;
	the underlying PAM system grants the request typically by adding the ccount to a group with elevated privileges.
	*tokios sistemos labai aukšto saugumo, bet retos. pvz kur naudojama: bankai, telekomunikacija*
