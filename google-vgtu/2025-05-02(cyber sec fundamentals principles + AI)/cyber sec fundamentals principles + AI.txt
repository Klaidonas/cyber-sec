fundamentiniai kibernetinio saugumo principai
	1. defense in depth
		defense in depth: creating multiple layers of security, like an obstacle course for attackers.examples:
			combining mfa;
			endpoint detection&response (EDR)
			firewalls
			vulnerability testing
			data encryption
			
	2. Least Privilege
		Least Privilege: grant users only the minimum access rights necessary to perform their job duties.
		And reducing attack surface by removing unused services(e.g. FTP, SSH if not needed), changing default ID's/passwords.
		
	3. Seperation Of Duties
		Seperation Of Duties: Ensure no single individual complete control over a a critical process. example:
			the person requesting access or a transaction cannot be the same person who approves it.
			
	4. Secure by Design
		Secure by Design: integrate security considerations from the very beginning of any project. Embed security requirements design,
		coding, installation, testing and production phases.
		
	5. KISS(keep it simple stupid)
		KISS: security measures should be effective but not overly complex for legitimate users. complexity is the enemy of security.
		
		
	6. Slaptumas !== Saugumas

	AI - simulating human intelligence(reasoining, learning, interface) in machines.

	Machine Learning(ML): subfield of AI focused on pattern recognition from data
	Deep Learning(DL): Subfield of ML using multi-layered neural networks, simulating human brain.

		LLM'ai gali generuoti neteisingas ar padirbtas detales:
			Sentence Contradiction
			Prompt Contradiction
			Factual contradiction
			Random Hallucinations
			
		Pagrindinės priežastys:
			mokymosi limitacijos
			duomenų užterštumas(contamination)
			blogi prompt'ai
		The Nature of LLM's: AI generates output by sampling probabilities of tokens.
